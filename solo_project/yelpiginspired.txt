I would like to create more of an Instagram + Yelp combination application where a user can log-in and post photos of their favorite food from restaurants all over the area.
Photos will be categorized by city

Features:
Login/Registration with Validation

Users will be able to upload (and rate? not sure yet) a photo and like/comment other peoples photos as well, if logged in.
Users will have to specify what city and name of the restaurant when uploading a photo
Users will be able to delete posts and edit descriptions.
(Eventually -- you'll be able to search up a specific restaurant and it should display all the photos users uploaded for that restaurant,
you'll also be able to search up specific food)

Photos will be displayed in the Homepage (Which photos should be featured here?)
