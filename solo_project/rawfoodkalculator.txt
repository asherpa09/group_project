I have 2 alaskan malamutes and 1 cat and I personally rawfeed all of 3 of them.
I have a passion for rawfeeding and I really feel strongly about keeping my animals as healthy as they can be. I've been rawfeeding for almost 5 years now and although it is a bit more pricier than regular store bought kibble, the outcome has been rewarding and hopefully this will extend my animals' life span.
I've also helped alot of my friends and acquiantances switch their animals to raw.

This process can be overwhelming at first so I would like to create a raw food calculator as a guide for new rawfeeders.

App functionality:
Users will be required to login/register with validation
You can add a pet to your profile that will require user to input their pet's information that will redirect them to the calculator page that will also have a weight conversion chart and percentage guideline.
There will be a profile page for the user that will house a chart with their pet's information that can be updated.
User can logout

Eventually, I would like to add a "Forum" link where users can posts questions/concerns/or just share their personal journey, as well as comment/like other users posts as well. I would also like to add a "Helpful Links" page that will house a bunch of helpful links to articles and pages regarding rawfeeding.
